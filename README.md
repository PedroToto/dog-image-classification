# DogImages Classification using AWS SageMaker
In this project we were asking to use AWS Sagemaker to train a pretrained model that can perform image classification by using the Sagemaker profiling, debugger, hyperparameter tuning and other good ML engineering practices. This can be done on either the provided dog breed classication data if you want to practice with this code you can set or one of your choice.

# Dataset
The provided dataset is the dogbreed classification dataset which can be found in the classroom. The project is designed to be dataset independent so if there is a dataset that is more interesting or relevant to your work, you are welcome to use it.
